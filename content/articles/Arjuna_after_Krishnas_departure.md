This story happened long before in those early days of A.M. when Dada Para'satya'nandaji was very close to Ba'ba'. He used to visit Ba'ba' for massaging. In one such occasion when he was massaging Ba'ba' one dark spot on Baba's right foot drew Dada's attention. Dada could not find any reason for this spot as he knew that Baba never walk bare footed on thorny places. Out of curiosity Dada asked Ba'ba' the reason for this spot. Ba'ba' avoided this topic by telling that it was not very important to know. Dada's curiosity became stronger and insisted again to Baba to tell the reason, Baba again wanted to avoid by telling it's a long story so no need to mention. Dada again more strongly insisted to know the story. Then finally Baba narrated the story.

About 3500 years ago after the Maha'bha'rata war was over when Shrii Krs'na's age was 80 years at a particular moment He had an appointment to meet Arjuna at a particular place in the forest. He was resting under a tree beside a pond in His Laliita Mudra' (placing a foot on another foot) while waiting for Arjuna to come. At that time by His both sides were two Avadhutas. Ba'ba' commented that Shrii Krs'n'a had twelve Avadhutas.

A hunter was passing by who mistook the beautiful feet of Shrii Krs'n'a to be an animal and shot poisonous arrow which struck Shrii Krs'n'a's feet. Out of the reaction of the poison, His Body became affected and turned bluish. Both the Avadhutas who were with Him were shocked. Shrii Krs'n'a calmed them down and told them that at any moment Arjuna will come and He will not be able to maintain His Body before his arrival. So he wanted to leave three messages for Arjuna with them. In the mean time the hunter was in deep grief after knowing his blunder and apologized to Lord Krs'n'a. Lord Krs'n'a forgave the hunter by telling that he did it unknowingly and he will not acquire any sin for this action.

So, the three message for Arjuna to be conveyed by the Avadhutas were: 

* Arjuna will certainly be disturbed to hear this news but he should not harm the hunter.
* His Body should be cremated and not to be buried. 
* Third instruction was on some political aspect to shift a particular population from Dvaraka to Mathura.

The two Avadhutas who were with Shrii Krs'n'a requested Him not to leave His Body until Arjuna comes but He refused and left His Body.

When Arjuna arrived he became extremely distressed and broken-hearted.

Arjuna had ego of his command on his Ga'nd'iiva and his excellency in the science of archery. While carrying out the third instruction of shifting the the above mentioned people from Dva'raka' to Mathura', he was arrested by the forest revels. Then his Ga'nd'iiva and knowledge of archery could not do any miracle. Then only he realized that everything was being done by Shrii Krs'n'a Himself. He was just like a puppet in the hands of Shrii Krs'n'a. The supreme surrender came in to his mind. He realised his friend Shrii Krs'n'a was none but Paramapurusa.

Ba'ba' then asked Dada Para'satya'nandaji, "will you also cry when I leave?" Dada replied, "Ba'ba', don't talk like this. You will be with us forever." Ba'ba': "No, it is not possible, one day I shall have to leave also."Dada expressed to Ba'ba' that he would not like to see that scene. Ba'ba' commented to him, "You won't see that."

Years later...

On the 26th October, 1990 Dada Parasatyanandaji was in a remote part of his diocese (Sagar in MP State). After his breakfast he saw the newspaper which says, "The founder of AM Shrii Shrii A'nandamurti has passed away and His last rites are due today"

It was shocking for him. He telephonically confirmed that heart breaking news. He rushed to Kalika'ta' to find that everything finished, even His ashes were carried away. He became furious on the Central workers for not informing him and he was fighting with them. But all of a sudden he withdrew himself from fighting and became silent. Because he remembered His words, "You won't see that".

"Lord Krishna was also apparently with two avadhutas. Krishna knew Arjuna would be angry and will try to kill the hunter. Krishna told the two avadhutas who had accompanied Him to tell Arjuna that it was an accident and the hunter was not to be blamed, so no harm should be done to the hunter. 

Later when Arjuna heard about the whole episode he still came to the jungle, supposedly to kill the hunter. But he could not shoot well. Arjuna was then stopped by the forest police. Arjuna tried to fight with the police, but failed. He then realized that it was Lord Krishna, who was no more with him, had given him the strength and the power to shoot his arrows. The story did not say what happened to Arjuna after he was arrested."
