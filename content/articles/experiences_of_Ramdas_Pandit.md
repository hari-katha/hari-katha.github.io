All stories below are from personal texts sent from Shrii Ramdas Pandit, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.

In summer of year of 1968 Baba visited Delhi. Before morning General Darshan as routine we arranged visit for Purana Kila ( Old Fort ) as a part of morning walk.  Baba was accompanied with R.Prasad ( Collector Central Excise) , Mangal  Bihari (IAS officer Gov.of India) Dr. P.K.Kymal, Venu Gopalan ( Ass.Com. Finance), Ravindra Dutta....it was nice group of devoted Margis. We reached at the foot of Purana Kila by car and finally entered in gorgeous gate of Purana Kila. 
It was pleasant atmosphere and Baba looked very very bright and satisfied. We reached at small open ground. Suddenly Baba stopped and looked at sky above him. He raised His right arm and pointed to various part of sky with His fore finger as if locating something in vast Universe.  Suddenly Baba became serious. 

"OH...no...it is very bad.. " BABA  whispered. We all were stunned for awhile but nobody dared to speak anything. Baba closed His eyes  and slowly opened and looked at everyone of us. He said " ....stars and constellations are arranged today exactly in the same position as they were in time of Mahabharat... the earth is entering in very very tough times of transition." Baba continued ".... the world will witness series of natural calamities,  unknown viruses with  waves of pandemic will attack human races all around the world...and world will plunge into world wars..." BABA continued " .... there will be great loss of human population around the world... the two third world wide population of human races will be destroyed ....

We all were again speechless and stunned. Baba explained "....Prakriti (Mother Nature) is very very annoyed. Even I will not able to save human race from anger of Prakriti ...". We all were stunned and speechless. After little walk we found a nice place under a tree. We sat in circle around BABA. After some time BABA  continued "....Prakriti is annoyed because humans at large are violating norms of nature to great extent... so Prakriti is highly revenge fully attacking all around the world. I will only manage to save Anandmargis in the world...." BABA further revealed "....there will be tremendous scarcity of food grains all over the world.  Even if there will be some produce of grains in farms it will not reach peaple as there will be extreme problems of law and orders..." Finally BABA give special advice "..... all Margis must store food grains minimum for one and half years in this period... all Margis should follow 16 points strictly..." . 

The above discussion happened in front of me. 
I am forwarding above event as we all are witnessing sequence of natural calamities and virus attacks and weaves of pandemics as first signal as per BABA 's forecasting. So let us become safe by following 16 points and Sadhana as per BABA 's instructions.
