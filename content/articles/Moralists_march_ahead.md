There was a DMC in Dhurba, Ranchi on the  10th  November 1964. During  the  noon discourse of Bábá, He said, “A perpetual war  is  going  on between  the  demonic  and the righteous forces and  it will  continue.  Good and bad, moralists  and  immoralists cannot co-exist.  One will have to surrender  before he other.  There cannot be a truce  between 
the two.  It is  the  desire of  Parama Puruśa that moralists should  dominate  the  society."

Later that day, I got  the  opportunity to meet Bábá  at  4 p.m. After  inquiring  about  other things, HE asked, "How did you like my noon discourse?" I replied, "It was  excellent. But I have a  question, Bábá.   If  you  permit me, I would like to put it to You." Bábá  smiled and said," Yes, you may. "In a  natural  way I said," Bábá,we are all aware that nothing happens without the desire of Parama Puruśa.Things happen  as  He  wishes.  As  it  is the  desire of Parama Puruśa that  moralists  should be dominant in the society, how is it that immoralists now  hold  the reins? This  is  against His  wish.   "Bábá   said  smilingly,  “Parama Puruśa encourages the  evil  forces  so that the righteous forces will develop determination and stamina to unite and  march ahead 
to fight."  

I  could  then  understand  that  all this was the play of Parama  Puruśa.
