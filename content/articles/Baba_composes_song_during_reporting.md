In September 1982, a few days before Bábá started composing Prabháta Saḿgiita, He was very angry with Dada Mantreshvarānanda for some reason. So Dada said, “Bábá, I am leaving! I don't want to be here with You!” Dada then took his suitcase and started to go.
Bábá called the other dadas and said, “That boy has become very angry. Go and bring him back.”
The dadas almost forcefully took Dada Mantreshvaránanda to Bábá's room. Everyone waited for Bábá to say something. Instead, Bábá started to sing a song in Bengali. Some of the lines were:

*"Ámi Vrndávane Vane Vane Dhenu Cad'ábo*  
*Khelte yata Bhálavási, Táito Phire Dharáy Ási*  
*Maner Matan Khelár Sáthi Kata jan Pábo"*  

The meaning of the song is: 
I will go for cow herding in the forests of Vrindávan. I like to play, That is what makes Me come again and again to this earth. Alas! My playmates are so few. I don't want to lose any of them as all are so precious to Me.

Then Bábá said, “You people are the luckiest ones. If you all maintain your spiritual discipline, in one life you can attain mokša. But I have to come again and again as I have to guide this world. One more problem of Mine is that I know everything about everybody. But how much do you all allow Me to reveal? You get so easily offended. You all misunderstand, thinking that I am here to only give you pain. But I love you all as you all are my precious playmates in this Vrindávan.”
Everyone was touched by Bábá's loving words. Dada Mantreshvaránanda started to cry very loudly like a baby. The situation was indescribable. How loving Bábá was at that moment. Though He is free from all bondages, at the same He is also bound with such a strong loving bond with us. It is wonderful.
Later, when Bábá gave Prabháta Saḿgiita, Bábá mentioned that earlier song and said, “Even if you want that song to be included in the list of Prabháta Saḿgiita, I will not do it. Because My little boy Mantreshvarānanda has got some memory with that song. He will feel sad every time people will sing that. So let's not include that in the Prabhat Samgiita list.”
