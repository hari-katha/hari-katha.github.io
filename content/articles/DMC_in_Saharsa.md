There was a DMC in Saharsa, Bihar. During the train journey, Baba sat for sadhana in His compartment. A person by the name of Kapil Narayan Suhurta who was a politician and an accomplished writer in Hindi was sitting nearby, watching Baba curiously. He started talking to a Margii who was with Baba. The Margii told him that Baba is the founder of Ananda Marga.

Kapil became curious and so asked Baba,
"What is your profession?"

Baba smiled and replied, "I write articles."

Kapil asked, "In which language do you write?"

"I write in all the languages of the world."

Kapil was surprised and asked further, "On which subjects do you write?"

"I write on all subjects." Then Baba asked him suddenly, "What is the meaning of Suhurta?"

Kapil was astonished that Baba knew his name. He admitted that he did not know. Baba said, "You are an intellectual, so how is it that you don't know the meaning of your own name?"

Baba then went on to explain the meaning of Suhurta in many different languages for 45 minutes until the train arrived at Shapur Kamal.

After the DMC, on the journey back to Jamalpur, Baba stopped at Mansi for the train interchange, but the scheduled train going to Jamalpur was to arrive two hours later. The Margiis knew this and had arranged some refreshments for Baba. One devotee named Asarfi Mandal had the duty of washing Baba's hands. Because he was illiterate, Asarfi had an inferiority complex. He said, "Baba, everyone in Ananda Marga is intellectual."

Baba replied, "Yes, that is true. Everyone except you and I."

As soon as Asarfi heard this, he dropped the pitcher of water and collapsed in samadhi.
