<div class='tco1 arttito'>Initiation at Rourkella<br /><br /></div>
<div class='tco1 arttext'>
In the year 1971, when I worked in Orissa, I visited the town of Rourkella. I conducted a meeting and talked with the local college students. One of them asked me to return with him to his hostel room to teach him meditation. I had some leaflets about sadhana, Yama and Niyama, the 15 Shiilas and the Supreme Command. As I entered the boy&#39;s room, I saw a man sitting on a chair outside the room. Actually, he was the father of the boy, but I did not know it at that time. So I did not pay any attention to him. <br />
 <br />
I entered the boy&#39;s room and requested him to lock the door from the inside. I then taught him the process of meditation. When I was almost finished, I heard a knock on the door. The knocking became very loud. Hearing the loud knocks, the boy became terrified. He told me, &quot;Dada, now we have to open the door. Maybe it is my father and the hostel warden who want to know what is going on.&quot; Then, as he unlocked the door I mentally prayed, &quot;Baba, I am only doing Your work, so please save me.&quot; <br />
 <br />
When we opened the door, we saw the boy&#39;s father, the hostel warden and even a few policemen standing with a grim look on their faces. All of them were clearly angry. I later learnt that when I entered the room, the father, who was sitting outside, felt insulted that I did not acknowledge him or seek his permission to teach his son meditation. For this reason, he immediately informed the hostel warden and the police. <br />
 <br />
The police requested us to go to the police station, which was very near the hostel. We arrived at the police station, and as I was about to go inside, the thought of Baba came in my mind suddenly, as if He were telling me, &quot;Don&#39;t worry!&quot; <br />
 <br />
When we entered the room we saw that the officer-in-charge was punishing a thief. We waited quietly for him to finish. After dealing with the thief, he asked us what the matter was. I told him that I was a monk and that I taught morality and meditation. I explained that I was invited by the boy into his hostel room, as he was interested to know about the practical aspects of meditation. I then gave my leaflets on meditation to the officer. It was in the local language. <br />
 <br />
The police officer was very pleased to see the leaflets. He scolded the father of the boy, saying, &quot;Why do you unnecessarily harass this monk? He is doing good work.&quot; Thus, I left the town of Rourkella in honor and with dignity. <br />
 <br />
Fifteen days later I went to the Central Office in Patna. When I visited Baba in jail, He asked me casually, &quot;How was your pracar? Did you face any difficulty?&quot; I did not understand what He meant, because so many other things had happened that I had forgotten that particular incident. Then, He gently asked, &quot;Did that police officer behave nicely with you? Did he solve your problem?&quot; <br />
 <br />
In a flash, I realized that Baba was reminding me of the episode at Rourkella. I had not mentioned the story to anyone. Realizing how lovingly He looks after the welfare of His children, I could not control my tears of gratitude.
