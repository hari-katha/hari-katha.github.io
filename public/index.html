<p>That is <em>The Lord is boundless, His Stories are boundless</em>. When Parama Puruśa decides to take the human form, he has some key purposes.
<em>Why does he take the human form?</em> What are his purposes?
Excerpt from Shrii Shrii Anandmurtii&rsquo;s discourse<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;Parama Puruśa is beyond temporal, spatial and personal boundaries. The human heart is not satisfied with that <em>Impersonal</em> Entity. The human heart wants something closer, something more sentimental, something more pleasing. And thatʼs why just to satisfy, just to give pleasure to, His progeny, He comes within the scope of these relative factors. Parama Puruśa becomes <em>Táraka Brahma</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now when the society is in a degenerate or depraved condition, where fissiparous tendencies dominate, where the static principle dominates, it becomes impossible for Parama Puruśa to remain unaffected or unassailed by human sentiments and human cries and human demands. Then and then only does He come in the form of Táraka Brahma. Táraka means “The Liberator.” And that Táraka is the Bábá of the created world. For Him devotees sing, <em>Bábá náma kevalam</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here we see He has two reasons, purposes to take the human form. Our subject in this project is the first one. Where He becomes a <em>personal</em> entity which showers love to ALL. Not just those blessed ones who are in His contact, but even those who never met him in person, even those who just by hearing about his experiences, his stories, his leela.. even those drown in His devotion.</p>
<p>At the time of Lord Shiva, scripts were not invented yet <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, but shruti (spoken) languages were prevalent. Hence a large portion of Lord Shiva&rsquo;s stories were eventually lost. During Lord Krishna&rsquo;s time, script was already invented. Hence much of His leelas were documented. This time we hope to do better. To help with that we want to document all experiences, along with references, chronology, details.</p>
