      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;beginnings-with-my-father&#34;&gt;Beginnings with my father&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am Padmakar Laxman Vispute. My parents, my children and their children are all ananda margiis by Baba&amp;rsquo;s grace. The first margii in our family was my father Laxman Vispute. He hailed from Jalgaon in Maharashtra. My father in his teenage years was already a devotee. He used to say that he wants to become a sanyasii (monk). He didn&amp;rsquo;t want to marry. With his thirst he already had found a guru who was known as Tukdoji Maharaja. He spent some years with Tukdoji and was hoping to become a sansyasii under him. Tukdoji convinced my father, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t become a sanyasii, lead a married life. Do not worry, you will find a good guru in future and you will find God.&amp;rdquo; And his words came true! In some way Tukdoji Maharaja knew that my father will meet Baba.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
