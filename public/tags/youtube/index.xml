      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dada was with Baba when Baba was touring Europe, talking many things like Atlantis, Prout and sport, specifically boxing, which Baba said He used to do when young. Dada talked about his time in Australia including his “War on Dharma”, and other dramas to get Baba released from jail. Dadaji talked about jokes Baba made with him and a story regarding the fear some had toward Him and Prout, and why.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
