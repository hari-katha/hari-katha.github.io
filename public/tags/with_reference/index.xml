      <description>&lt;p&gt;In September 1982, a few days before Bábá started composing Prabháta Saḿgiita, He was very angry with Dada Mantreshvarānanda for some reason. So Dada said, “Bábá, I am leaving! I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be here with You!” Dada then took his suitcase and started to go.&#xA;Bábá called the other dadas and said, “That boy has become very angry. Go and bring him back.”&#xA;The dadas almost forcefully took Dada Mantreshvaránanda to Bábá&amp;rsquo;s room. Everyone waited for Bábá to say something. Instead, Bábá started to sing a song in Bengali. Some of the lines were:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many do not take Guru Puja seriously. They recite the lines like a chant in a hurry to get it over with as soon as possible because it is just a final formality after having finished their sadhana.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once Acarya Tapeshvaranandaji was traveling on the train. He began doing pracar to the people nearby. After some discussion, one person looked at him and asked in a very grave, powerful way, &amp;ldquo;Are you seriously trying to tell me that by doing this sadhana, we will get mukti (liberation)?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Acarya Cidananda Avadhuta relates his experience With BABA prior to joining the organisation as a whole-time worker  He was then working as an engineer in the coal mining company NCDC, Bihar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He narrates: “As per my usual routine, I had gone to Jamalpur to ask Baba where should I go to spend my vacation. He asked me to  go home and come back soon. When I did sāṣṭānga pranam (prostration) and was about to leave his room Baba gestured me to come near him and asked, “How many cattle do you have in your family?” I replied, “ Two milking cows, two calves, two buffaloes and one pair of bulls for ploughing land.  Baba, “ Do you know that one of your buffaloes which yield&#xA;two litres of milk everyday has been sick for the last four days? She has high fever and pain from a kind of boil on her neck and nobody is taking care of her. Go and take care of her. Please bring me four buds of China roses.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Dada talked about his time in Australia including his “War on Dharma”, and other dramas to get Baba released from jail. Dadaji talked about jokes Baba made with him and a story regarding the fear some had toward Him and Prout, and why.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;blessing-of-being-babas-doctor&#34;&gt;Blessing of Being Baba’s Doctor&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dharmadas Kalwar was one of the doctors posted in Bankipur Central Jail in Patna. This Jail is now called Buddha Smriti Park and is walking distance from Patna station.&#xA;Initially the doctor was not assigned to treat Baba. However, he used to see Baba sometimes in passing. One day there was a huge commotion in the Jail and the prisoners were getting ready to riot. There was a prisoner who fought for the rights of all the prisoners and spoke out against the corruption in the Jail like Baba did. When his demands were not met, he declared he would go on a hunger strike. However, after a few days, due to previous ill health, he could not endure this fasting. He told the guards he wanted to break his fasts. The guards laughed at him saying he was a fraud. They did not give him food or water. They used to drink water in front of him or pour it on the groud in front of his cell. Finally, one day this prisoner was found unconscious in the cell. The Jail staff could not revive him. The news spread like wildfire in the prison. All the prisoners in the prison were shouting with anger. It seemed a prison riot was about to happen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;beginnings-with-my-father&#34;&gt;Beginnings with my father&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am Padmakar Laxman Vispute. My parents, my children and their children are all ananda margiis by Baba&amp;rsquo;s grace. The first margii in our family was my father Laxman Vispute. He hailed from Jalgaon in Maharashtra. My father in his teenage years was already a devotee. He used to say that he wants to become a sanyasii (monk). He didn&amp;rsquo;t want to marry. With his thirst he already had found a guru who was known as Tukdoji Maharaja. He spent some years with Tukdoji and was hoping to become a sansyasii under him. Tukdoji convinced my father, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t become a sanyasii, lead a married life. Do not worry, you will find a good guru in future and you will find God.&amp;rdquo; And his words came true! In some way Tukdoji Maharaja knew that my father will meet Baba.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This story happened long before in those early days of A.M. when Dada Para&amp;rsquo;satya&amp;rsquo;nandaji was very close to Ba&amp;rsquo;ba&amp;rsquo;. He used to visit Ba&amp;rsquo;ba&amp;rsquo; for massaging. In one such occasion when he was massaging Ba&amp;rsquo;ba&amp;rsquo; one dark spot on Baba&amp;rsquo;s right foot drew Dada&amp;rsquo;s attention. Dada could not find any reason for this spot as he knew that Baba never walk bare footed on thorny places. Out of curiosity Dada asked Ba&amp;rsquo;ba&amp;rsquo; the reason for this spot. Ba&amp;rsquo;ba&amp;rsquo; avoided this topic by telling that it was not very important to know. Dada&amp;rsquo;s curiosity became stronger and insisted again to Baba to tell the reason, Baba again wanted to avoid by telling it&amp;rsquo;s a long story so no need to mention. Dada again more strongly insisted to know the story. Then finally Baba narrated the story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was a DMC in Saharsa, Bihar. During the train journey, Baba sat for sadhana in His compartment. A person by the name of Kapil Narayan Suhurta who was a politician and an accomplished writer in Hindi was sitting nearby, watching Baba curiously. He started talking to a Margii who was with Baba. The Margii told him that Baba is the founder of Ananda Marga.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kapil became curious and so asked Baba,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What is your profession?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Vishwaroop by Baba</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since childhood I had a strong desire to see Vishvarúpa, the Universal Form of God, because in the Mahábhárata Krsna showed Arjuna his universal form and I thought, &amp;ldquo;If Arjuna can see it then why not me?&amp;rdquo; Even before coming to the Márga I had this desire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So once during a darshan in 1968, Bábá called me to sit in front of him. He told me to be seated in lotus posture, keeping my spinal cord straight. He touched my ájiná cakra with his finger, and with his touch my whole body and mind became purified and started vibrating with spiritual current. &amp;ldquo;What do you see?,&amp;rdquo; Bábá asked me. &amp;ldquo;Bábá, I see you sitting on a golden lion. You are smiling.&amp;rdquo; Then He said, &amp;ldquo;Concentrate your mind on sahasrára cakra. What do you see?” &amp;ldquo;Baba, I see a golden effulgence.&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Go deeper. Penetrate your mind and see each and every part of your body.&amp;rdquo; I started seeing Sadguru Ánandamúrti present in each and every molecule of my flesh in the affectionate and gracious pose of varábhaya mudra, with smiling and charming face. He was not there in a body made of flesh, blood, bones, etc, but in the divine form of effulgence. Then He ordered me to withdraw my mind from the flesh and to enter into and visualise each and every part of the bones of my body. I did accordingly and saw the same glittering, shining effulgent divine form. Then he ordered my mind to expand and see into all the solid factor of the universe. I visualised that vast solid factor with millions of planets, galaxies, nebulae and stars, as all the things were in my mind. In that state my mind soared into an&#xA;indescribable world of effulgence. I saw the whole universe. Bábá told me to concentrate on every molecule of the universe. I did. My mind could encompass the entire universe penetrate each and every molecule. Lord Anandamúrti was sitting everywhere in the gracious and effulgent form of varábhaya mudra with his ever-smiling face.&#xA;Then he ordered my mind to cross, penetrate, expand and see the liquid, luminous, aerial and etherial factors respectively. My mind visualized His divine form accordingly without any effort, merely by his grace and wish.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
