My parents, my children and their children are all ananda margiis by Baba\u0026rsquo;s grace. The first margii in our family was my father Laxman Vispute. He hailed from Jalgaon in Maharashtra. My father in his teenage years was already a devotee. He used to say that he wants to become a sanyasii (monk). He didn\u0026rsquo;t want to marry. With his thirst he already had found a guru who was known as Tukdoji Maharaja. He spent some years with Tukdoji and was hoping to become a sansyasii under him. Tukdoji convinced my father, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t become a sanyasii, lead a married life. Do not worry, you will find a good guru in future and you will find God.\u0026rdquo; And his words came true! In some way Tukdoji Maharaja knew that my father will meet Baba.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Experiences of Vispute Family"},{"content":["Get","in","touch","In","case","you","have","corrections,","suggestions,","or","any","other","relevant","information,","please","feel","to","share","with","me","in","the","form","below.","If","you","have","any","stories,","notes,","recordings","of","experiences","with","Shrii","Shrii","Anandamurtii","(Baba),","that","you","would","like","to","share","with","the","world,","then","please","message","me.","I","shall","try","to","come","in","contact","with","you","and","ensure","that","your","story","is","documented","on","this","site.","Name:","Email:","Message:","Send"],"permalink":"https://harikatha.eu/contact/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"get-in-touch\"\u003eGet in touch\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn case you have \u003cem\u003ecorrections\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003esuggestions\u003c/em\u003e, or any other relevant information, please feel to share with me in the form below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have any \u003cem\u003estories\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003enotes\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003erecordings\u003c/em\u003e of experiences with Shrii Shrii Anandamurtii (Baba), that you would like to share with the world, then please message me.

childhood I had a strong desire to see Vishvarúpa, the Universal Form of God, because in the Mahábhárata Krsna showed Arjuna his universal form and I thought, \u0026ldquo;If Arjuna can see it then why not me?\u0026rdquo; Even before coming to the Márga I had this desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo once during a darshan in 1968, Bábá called me to sit in front of him. He told me to be seated in lotus posture, keeping my spinal cord straight. He touched my ájiná cakra with his finger, and with his touch my whole body and mind became purified and started vibrating with spiritual current. \u0026ldquo;What do you see?,\u0026rdquo; Bábá asked me. \u0026ldquo;Bábá, I see you sitting on a golden lion. You are smiling.\u0026rdquo; Then He said, \u0026ldquo;Concentrate your mind on sahasrára cakra. What do you see?” \u0026ldquo;Baba, I see a golden effulgence.\u0026rdquo; He said, \u0026ldquo;Go deeper. Penetrate your mind and see each and every part of your body.\u0026rdquo; I started seeing Sadguru Ánandamúrti present in each and every molecule of my flesh in the affectionate and gracious pose of varábhaya mudra, with smiling and charming face. He was not there in a body made of flesh, blood, bones, etc, but in the divine form of effulgence. Then He ordered me to withdraw my mind from the flesh and to enter into and visualise each and every part of the bones of my body. I did accordingly and saw the same glittering, shining effulgent divine form. Then he ordered my mind to expand and see into all the solid factor of the universe. I visualised that vast solid factor with millions of planets, galaxies, nebulae and stars, as all the things were in my mind. In that state my mind soared into an\nindescribable world of effulgence. I saw the whole universe. Bábá told me to concentrate on every molecule of the universe. I did. My mind could encompass the entire universe penetrate each and every molecule. Lord Anandamúrti was sitting everywhere in the gracious and effulgent form of varábhaya mudra with his ever-smiling face.\nThen he ordered my mind to cross, penetrate, expand and see the liquid, luminous, aerial and etherial factors respectively. My mind visualized His divine form accordingly without any effort, merely by his grace and wish.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Vishwaroop by Baba"}]
