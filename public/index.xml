      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since childhood I had a strong desire to see Vishvarúpa, the Universal Form of God, because in the Mahábhárata Krsna showed Arjuna his universal form and I thought, &amp;ldquo;If Arjuna can see it then why not me?&amp;rdquo; Even before coming to the Márga I had this desire.&#xA;So once during a darshan in 1968, Bábá called me to sit in front of him. He told me to be seated in lotus posture, keeping my spinal cord straight. He touched my ájiná cakra with his finger, and with his touch my whole body and mind became purified and started vibrating with spiritual current. &amp;ldquo;What do you see?,&amp;rdquo; Bábá asked me. &amp;ldquo;Bábá, I see you sitting on a golden lion. You are smiling.&amp;rdquo; Then He said, &amp;ldquo;Concentrate your mind on sahasrára cakra. What do you see?” &amp;ldquo;Baba, I see a golden effulgence.&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Go deeper. Penetrate your mind and see each and every part of your body.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;I started seeing Sadguru Ánandamúrti present in each and every molecule of my flesh in the affectionate and gracious pose of varábhaya mudra, with smiling and charming face. He was not there in a body made of flesh, blood, bones, etc, but in the divine form of effulgence.&#xA;Then He ordered me to withdraw my mind from the flesh and to enter into and visualise each and every part of the bones of my body. I did accordingly and saw the same glittering, shining effulgent divine form.&#xA;Then he ordered my mind to expand and see into all the solid factor of the universe. I visualised that vast solid factor with millions of planets, galaxies, nebulae and stars, as all the things were in my mind. In that state my mind soared into an&#xA;indescribable world of effulgence. I saw the whole universe.&#xA;Bábá told me to concentrate on every molecule of the universe. I did. My mind could encompass the entire universe penetrate each and every molecule.&#xA;Lord Anandamúrti was sitting everywhere in the gracious and effulgent form of varábhaya mudra with his ever-smiling face.&#xA;Then he ordered my mind to cross, penetrate, expand and see the liquid, luminous, aerial and etherial factors respectively. My mind visualized His divine form accordingly without any effort, merely by his grace and wish.&#xA;At last He commanded my mind to expand into each and every atom and particle of this universe. They were innumerable and countless. Lord Anandamúrti was sitting in each and every particle in the posture of Varabhaya Mudra with smiling face, His form was made of divine effulgence and was more bright and shining than the light of millions of suns.&#xA;By visualising and realizing this universal form of Sadguru Bábá, my mind entered into the formless state. Thus my unit&#xA;consciousness was completely merged into the divine ocean of Supreme Consciousness and I forgot about my surroundings.&#xA;After that, I did not know when the Lord and devotees left the room.&#xA;When I finally regained consciousness, I remained in a state of continuous spiritual bliss for three days, and even after that the divine impression was in my mind for many months.&#xA;When I remember those divine experiences I still feel much spiritual inspiration and enlightenment and it gives me new light, vision and energy in my body, mind and soul.&#xA;Later Baba told me, &amp;ldquo;That effulgent form is the real Anandamúrti. To understand Ánandamúrti is the real goal of sádhaná. But when I am in the physical form I am the president of this organization. I am sitting on the head of the golden lion.&#xA;This is my Dhyána Sundaram. Every sinner has the right to sit on my lap. The only way to realize Me is in the sahasrára cakra.&#xA;There my universal form resides.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
