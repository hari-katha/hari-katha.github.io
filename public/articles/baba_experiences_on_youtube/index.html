      <p>Dada was with Baba when Baba was touring Europe, talking many things like Atlantis, Prout and sport, specifically boxing, which Baba said He used to do when young. Dada talked about his time in Australia including his “War on Dharma”, and other dramas to get Baba released from jail. Dadaji talked about jokes Baba made with him and a story regarding the fear some had toward Him and Prout, and why.</p>
<h4><a href="https://youtu.be/BPVAryC3ppg"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://youtu.be/BPVAryC3ppg</a></h4>
<p>Dadaji describes his early struggles to find God and guru and the test he gave to Baba, tells of some intimate conversations with Baba as well as Baba reacting to his kali worship, dada getting clash and planning to leave AM.
Kundalini experiences and getting a boon from Baba. Dada gives his opinion regarding the best sadhana to experience Baba and explains Vishesh Yoga, second session and Madhu Gosti bhava. He also tells what Baba said to him about Guru cakra and advice to those margiis who came after Baba had left his body.</p>
<h4><a href="https://youtu.be/jcmtJ5e1ojY"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://youtu.be/jcmtJ5e1ojY</a></h4>
<p>Dada Bhodaprajnananda tells some inspiring Baba stories, especially one where Baba tell him how to deal the clash he was having with the organisation etc, as well as Baba showing him what the future of Ananda Marga will look like. Baba also revealed to Dada His omniscience.</p>
<h4><a href="https://youtu.be/9i00ShS1KpE"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://youtu.be/9i00ShS1KpE</a></h4>
<p>Author of the popular book, Travels with the Mystic Master, Dadaji talks about the intense struggle he had doing WT training in India, about how he tried in vain to find fault in Baba , the glories of kiirtan, and advice for developing love for Baba even if you  have never been able to meet him. Dada commented on how different Baba behaved outside of India, particularly towards margii sisters. Dada also commented on Baba&rsquo;s  views on eating cheese!</p>
<h4><a href="https://youtu.be/w5i9ucHuM0Q"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://youtu.be/w5i9ucHuM0Q</a></h4>
<p>Dada is best know for his TEDx talk &ldquo;Consciousness: the Final Frontier&rdquo; , with over 6 million views! He also created recently a very popular video on Baba called &ldquo;Embodiment of Bliss&rdquo;. Dada speaks about these projects as well as how he became a monk of Ananda Marga and his feelings about being initiated after Baba had left His body. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo0X2ZdElQ4&amp;t=858s%29"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo0X2ZdElQ4&t=858s)</a>,</p>
<h4><a href="https://youtu.be/or-uoRkf1rw"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://youtu.be/or-uoRkf1rw</a></h4>
<p>Baba stories and experiences covering how to deal with unwanted feelings, unwanted thoughts, what path to take and other words of wisdom. Unfortunately the sound quality is poor in many parts.</p>
<h4><a href="https://youtu.be/5U7a5qrqDQg"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://youtu.be/5U7a5qrqDQg</a></h4>
<p>Kishanji tells a remarkable life with Baba, including Baba telling him what it means to be God realised, does a demonstration that shows his past life, including the name Kishan was known by. Kishanji also spent several weeks with Baba after He got out of prison, caring for Baba’s infected eyes from the fasting.</p>
<h4><a href="https://youtu.be/kAZLhRT2YLY"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://youtu.be/kAZLhRT2YLY</a></h4>
<p>What was it that motivated Dadaji to get initiated and what was his first contact with Baba like?, Also why did Baba tell him to “do as I do”. Baba jokes with Dada about language and gives him the  feeling that Baba knows him better than he knows himself! Dadaji was one of the first margiis to go to Russia and explained what it was like and about him doing “soft Kiirtana” followed by an amazing sadhana! This is followed by more amazing Baba’s Liila/grace type of experiences doing pracar that attracted lots of young Russians to the Marga. Back in India Dada tells more  humorous adventures with Baba, going for Dharma Samiksa, funny and sweet interactions with Baba, including Baba removing a very deep desire Dada had.</p>
<h4><a href="https://youtu.be/lJGZDTDTQK0"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://youtu.be/lJGZDTDTQK0</a></h4>
<p>Dadaji explains the way he ended up a margii and WT dada. He talks about Babas comments on segregation in our schools, how He uses us for His work, how we should never hate ourselves, but others can hate us! Baba explains to Dadaji about getting salvation in this life or the next, and getting grace.</p>
<p>Baba explains the different kinds of music. Dada meets Baba in Bangkok and Baba tells about why Prout is not for selfish people. Also how to fight against Adharmik people in power, to remember Baba&rsquo;s MIP advice, and the importance of patience. The importance also of feeling you are special to Baba, his amazing experience at the Rio world religion conference, Baba&rsquo;s comments on how and who would establish Prout, as well as the work Dada had done to propagate Prout, including meeting with heads of government.</p>
<h4><a href="https://youtu.be/Cxebm1BoRr8"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://youtu.be/Cxebm1BoRr8</a></h4>
<p>For several months Dada endured a Venezuelan jail before his innocence was proven and he was released. During that time Dada describes the horrible conditions he had to endure, as well as how he enjoyed Baba&rsquo;s grace and finally how more divine drama awaited his release.</p>
<h4><a href="https://youtu.be/5e4rzV8rB4I"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://youtu.be/5e4rzV8rB4I</a></h4>
<p>During the 1975 State of Emergency, Dadaji was imprisoned and cruelly tortured. He was also divinely blessed by Baba!</p>
<h4><a href="https://youtu.be/6smafrV_xtg"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://youtu.be/6smafrV_xtg</a></h4>
<p>The last GS before Baba left His body, Dadaji has a wealth of experience with Baba, telling many intriguing stories, including how he joined Ananda Marga and met Baba, the reaction to Baba getting married as well as how Baba saved his life when he was just a young boy, long before ever meeting Baba!.
Dadaji talks about some property drama as well as the CBI conspiracy against Ananda Marga and Baba, including the role Baba&rsquo;s wife played, why Baba allowed Himself to get imprisoned, about Baba giving His wife, Uma Datta, a chance to return to the Marga, and Baba meeting His son Gaotam. Baba&rsquo;s last days and Baba banning a margii for life because he refused to follow a directive from Dadaji, when he was GS.</p>
<h4><a href="https://youtu.be/SWT1c2xRofQ"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://youtu.be/SWT1c2xRofQ</a></h4>
<p>Being convinced Baba had saved him from drowning, Dada joined Ananda Marga. He tells what Baba had reportedly said about what countries would first adopt Prout, Baba’s special protection of Taiwan, the miracles Baba played on His arresting policemen, and about Ananda Marga on other planets!</p>
<h4><a href="https://youtu.be/drjxWy-23b8"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://youtu.be/drjxWy-23b8</a></h4>
<p>Dadaji shares some of his sweet personal experiences with Baba, travelling with Him in India and Europe, Baba telling him Russia will soon be Proutist, the starting of Gurukula and some of its amazing students, the secret to getting Baba’s inner guidance, and more!</p>
<h4><a href="https://youtu.be/5aaUZ1cgfcg"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://youtu.be/5aaUZ1cgfcg</a></h4>
<p>Dada’s first meeting with Baba was a sweet tearful one. The next meeting he had involved being the subject of a demonstration by Baba. Later Baba played some dramas with him but also blesses him by removing some of his bad habits. Dadaji talks about his time in Africa, including the 1984 Global conference. Dada goes to Sweden for WT training where he had blissful kiirtans and sadhana. Baba plays some games with Dada before he can get Avadhuta diksa, relief work in African, a miracle from using Babas name and what Dada believes is the most import thing in life!</p>
<h4><a href="https://youtu.be/RD3mBTMT3MA"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://youtu.be/RD3mBTMT3MA</a></h4>
<p>Dada tells of having a Baba dream where he experiences Baba’s fragrance and then the next day others comment on the beautiful fragrance they could smell in his room and from his body! Also about hearing strange voiced coming from Baba&rsquo;s room, even though Baba was meant to be alone! Some discussion about Baba and His plants as well as one time Baba particularly liked the Kiirtana some western margiis were doing. One sister also said she was having trouble doing sadhana and Baba gives her advice to improve it, resulting in her going into samadhi! Baba says what we should say if asked where is Baba, when He is not physically with us. More Baba stories.</p>
