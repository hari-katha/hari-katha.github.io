      <p>The story of Lord Krishna&rsquo;s departure is well known. Lord Krishna was resting in part of a jungle, lying down, with his one leg on top of another. A hunter mistook his foot or toe to be a bird. From a distance the hunter shot a poisoned arrow aimed at the foot. On coming closer, he realized he had shot Lord Krishna. He had deep remorse. However Krishna assured him that it was an accident and that He forgives him. Lord Krisna soon left His mortal body. However what happened afterwards is less known. The Puranic stories goes about into various aspects. Following is supposedly mentioned by Baba (Shrii Shrri Anandamrtii). However we are missing cross verification.</p>
<p>Lord Krishna was also aparently with two avadhutas. Krishna knew Arjuna would be angry and will try to kill the hunter. Krishna told the two avadhutas who had accompanied Him to tell Arjuna that it was an accident and the hunter was not to be blamed, so no harm should be done to the hunter.</p>
<p>Later when Arjuna heard about the whole episode he still came to the jungle, supposedly to kill the hunter. But he could not shoot well. Arjuna was then stopped by the forest Police. Arjuna tried to fight with the Police, but could not. He then realized that it was Lord Krishna, who was no more with him, had given him the strength and the power to shoot his arrows. The story did not say what happened to Arjuna after he was arrested.</p>
